# Freelance Invoice Automation

Automated creation of LaTeX invoicing for freelancers.

It can calculate rates and several other math operations automatically using the `spreadtab` package.

## Usage

All the customizable content is inside the `details.yml` file so modify it to make it yours (obviously).

Just inside the directory run `make` and your invoice will be created.

## Requirements

[LaTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html) and some extra packages.

To install pandoc on macOS,

```
brew install pandoc
```
